## Introduction

The challenges in this directory are organized into different levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each challenge comes with a detailed problem description, sample inputs and outputs, and any necessary starter code.

## Challenge Categories

- **Easy**: Basic challenges to get you started and build your foundational skills.
- **Medium**: Intermediate challenges that require a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- **Hard**: Advanced challenges that test your problem-solving skills and prepare you for technical interviews.

## How to Use
